## 🔍 When to Archive Documents

Documents should be moved here when:

1. ✅ **Gap Analysis Complete** - The analysis has been completed and documented
2. ✅ **No Longer Actively Used** - The document is not referenced in active development
3. ✅ **Historical Reference Only** - The document is kept only for historical reference

---

**Note:** This document may still be useful for future feature planning, but it's archived to keep the main reference directory focused on actively used documents.
