# Canonical Documentation Index (Curated)

This index is intended to preserve the project’s core concepts and prevent regressions caused by mixing legacy and modern documentation.

## 1) Read first (always)

- `docs/developer/01-policy/DEVELOPER_POLICY.md`
  - Non-negotiables: reliability-first, backward compatibility, security-by-default.

- `docs/developer/02-quick-start/IMPLEMENTATION_EVERY_TIME_CHECKLIST.md`
  - The single best “every PR” checklist for this repo.

- `docs/developer/04-api/03-api-standards.md`
  - API structure and response contract.

## 2) System mental model (current architecture)

- `docs/super_dag/SYSTEM_CURRENT_STATE.md`
  - The concise “what exists today” map.

- `docs/developer/06-architecture/01-system-overview.md`
  - High-level architecture narrative and key modules.

## 3) Product governance (do not break)

- `docs/06-specs/PUBLISHED_IMMUTABLE_CONTRACT.md`
  - Published revision must be immutable; new work must pin compatible snapshots.

## 4) Roadmap (what matters next)

- `docs/ROADMAP_LUXURY_WORLD_CLASS.md`
  - Canonical epics and non-negotiables for 2026–2027.

## 5) CUT time doctrine (active 2026 work)

- `docs/06-specs/TIME_LAYERS_MICRO_LEDGER_TO_MAINSTREAM_PROJECTION_SPEC_2026_01_15.md`
- `docs/06-specs/CUT_TIME_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAYBOOK_2026_01_15.md`
- `docs/06-specs/CUT_INTEGRATION_AUDIT_2026_01_15.md`

## 6) Security hardening backlog (operationally important)

- `docs/audit/STANDARDIZATION_AUDIT_2026_01_07.md`
  - File-level hardening priority list and staged rollout approach.

## Legacy / historical (read only for context)

- Anything under `docs/archive/**` is considered legacy unless explicitly confirmed.
